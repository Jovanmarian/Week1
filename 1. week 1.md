### üóìÔ∏è Week 1: Introduction to Database (DB)

#### üìç Definition and Purpose of Database
Component of DBMS
- Collection of interrelated data
- Set of programs to access the data
- Convenient and efficient environment
Modem DB Systems
-Handle Structured and unstructured data
-Touch almost every aspect of our lives

Purpose of DBMS
-Data Redundancy: Information could be duplicated in multiple files, leading to mutiple copies of the same data. Ex: customer details appearing in different files.
-Inconsistency: Duplicated data could become inconsistent if one copy was updated and the other wasn't, resulting in discrepancies across files.
-Difficulty in accessing data: Lacking standardized query tools, custom code was required for each data retrieval task, making the process inefficient.
-Need for new programs: Every distinct operation required a separate program, increasing development time and complicating maintenance.
-Data Isolation: Data scattered across different files and formats meant that collecting specific information was cumbersome, requiring manual correlation.
-Integrity Problems: Data integrity rules were hardcoded into aplications. Changes to these rules risked introducing errors and required extensive testing.
-Challenges with Constraints: Altering or adding data constraints was diffcult due to their embedding within application code, reducing adaptability.
-Atomicity of Updates: The absence of atomicity meant system failures could leave databases in inconsistent states, such as incorplete fund transfers between accounts.
-Concurrent Access Issues: Without concurrency control, simultaneous modifications by multiple users could lead to data inconsistencies, like overdrawn account balances.
-Security Problems: File systems lacked granular access controls, making it challenging to restrict user access to specific data, such as limiting data visibility in a hospital setting.


#### üìç View of Data
View of Data
Data Models
A conceptual framework that determines the structure
Data Abstraction
Hide the complexity of data structures to represent data in the database

VOD Data Models
Data: the actual information that will be stored in the database. Ex: the names and addresses of customers in a business database.
Data relationships: describe how different pieces of data are connected to each other. Ex: In a university database, for instance, a student might be related to courses via enrollment records.
Data semantic: the meaning of the data. Ex: it isn't just about knowing that a database has a date field, but understanding that it represents a student's enrollment date.
Data constraints: rules that determine the permissible values or combinations of values for certain data. Ex:
a student's age cannot be negative, or
that an email address must be unique across all records.


#### üìç DB Languages, Design, Architecture, and Users and Administrator
Data Models Types:
Relational: Data distruktur di tabel
Entity-Relationship
Object-based
Semi-Structured

Abstraction:
Physical level
Logical level
View level

SQL:
Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
SQL Query Language

A person who has central control over the system is called a database
administrator (DBA). Functions of a DBA indude:
-Schema definition
-Storage structure and access-method definition
-Schema and physical-organization modification
-Granting of authorization for data access
-Routine maintenance
-Periodically backing up the database
-Ensuring that enough free disk space is available for normal operations, and upgrading disk space as required
-Monitoning jobs running on the database
